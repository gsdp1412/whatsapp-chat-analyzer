I would like to inform you all that I’m applying for the role of PR and I guess that the voting will happen today only. 

I believe that it’s an important as well as a responsible position. So before the voting happens, I would like everyone of us to meet at a place so that we all can discuss about our concerns, expectations or any question that may arise in our mind. 

I’m planning for *12:00 pm today in front of Aryabhatta hall* (jaha hm sbne document submit kre the on the day of reporting). I apologise for this short notice.

And I would request everyone to come who thinks that it’s something important for our class. And if somebody can’t come because of any reason, it’s really alright.

26/07/2022, 10:30 - K Vidhayak CVM Jha: *Hello dear friends,*
*I would like to point out some things that*

*This will be not a appropriate way for a elected CR that they will further continue as a CR if particular someone will be selected as a CR too.  _This clearly showed that they are not  interested to work for class and well-being of class, they are just interested to work with particularly someone else._* 

*Further there should not be any provision for IF-Then situation, if anyone is being selected as a CR then they have to continue otherwise they have to step back now*.

*As of now I am ok with any situations and if it is mandatory to girls have a CR From them then later on girls may select any CR from themselves.*

*And this is our badness that we don't have some good candidates for these opportunities who think for everyone.*
26/07/2022, 11:29 - K Vatsala Hemdan: Guys about the message I sent yesterday,
Devansh and I we have a particular way of working together. There are times when he takes care of all the work because I have issues of my own. I feel I won't be able to contribute my best with someone else.
Not that I don't think of everyone or I don't want the well being of class,infact its the exact opposite. In the end we all want what is best for the class.
26/07/2022, 17:40 - K Deepak Yadav: So the election commission of NITC gave the responsibility to me to conduct this massive election 😂

15/03/2023, 13:04 - K Saurav Singh: Dear Student Community,

Greetings from the Centre for Career Development (CCD-NITC),

In the recent years we have seen tremendous growth in terms of placements at our campus and there are still avenues where we can break our own record in placements and internships and that requires the effort of students and an Amazing Coding Culture at our campus. 

Let us together build a culture of Coding in our campus. As a beginning step, please join us to explore the world of competitive activities lined up by top recruiters.  We are organizing an information session in collaboration with Google Developer Students Club NIT Calicut (GDSC NITC) and AI Club NITC, for upcoming Hackathons, Google Summer of Code, Google Summer of Documentation and other competitions and Open source Activities for 1st, 2nd and 3rd year students. 

Tarush Mihir (Lead at GDSC NITC) is going to take an information Session about various opportunities and learning resources that goes unnoticed by most of the students.  Here you will get to know about the opportunity and how to get into it. 

All are requested to join us at Aryabhatta Hall at 5 PM on Thursday (16/03/23).

Learn what aligns to your future and growth.
Contributors: CCD, AI club and GDSC NITC.

Centre for Career Development

They(CCM incharge, FA, Faculties) assured us that they will tell CCD that MCA21 are performing very well and will asked  CCD to look into this matter to solve this issue.

For this i need the list of that companies along with college name (where company allows) & Job role(if available).

All the placed students who will go for internship, have to get permission from Dean. For this you have to give the name of your internal faculty under whom you will be doing the project( intership-project). Contact the available faculty members under whom you want to do project either by in-person or send them a request through mail with your and intership details.
*Make sure that the company where you will be doing the project(intership) will allow you to submit your work report of project on which you will be working*, you can't give the excuse that it's company bond I can't give(disclose) any information about project.
*Contact seniors of respective companies to get idea about it and procedures.*

An exciting proposal that could significantly enhance your post-graduation experience – the introduction of NITC Alumni Email IDs.


The possession of an NITC email ID has helped multiple students at different points in their academic journey at NITC. They command a significant legitimacy to your work as they associate you with the prestige and glory of this institute. As of yet, we lose our email ID when we leave the institute at the end of our program. We would like to introduce a permanent alumni email ID for all the graduates which they can possess indefinitely.


Many Tier 1 and Tier 2 institutions across India have already embraced alumni email IDs, contributing significantly to the growth and success of their alumni networks. For NITC, this move is strategic in ensuring our alumni community not only thrives but continues to make meaningful connections beyond the campus.


Take a moment to share your thoughts by filling out the survey on or before 11:59 pm, 14/12/2023 (Please give a peek into the benefits given below before concluding)



Benefits of a permanent mail ID for alumnus:


Professionalism: Elevate your communication.

Credibility: Ensure messages are received and acknowledged.

Security and Privacy: Enjoy a more secure channel.

Access to Resources: Tap into NITC's libraries and databases.

Internal Communication: Stay connected effortlessly.

Official Communication: Receive timely announcements.

Integration: Seamlessly interact with other platforms.

Educational and Career Opportunities: Get exclusive notifications.

Consistency: Your alumni email ID remains constant.

Alumni Networks: Continued access for connections.

Fill the above form.

In case we go for more graphics in design, print quality might be compromised. And it may not last long. That's why there is minimal design.
